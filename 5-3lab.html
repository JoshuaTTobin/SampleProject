        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called 
          <dfn><i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food 
          (usally vacuum-sealed in plastic) into water bath that is percisely set to the target temperature
        you want to the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite> cooking for greeks</cite>. Jeff Potter
         describes it as <p>ultra-low temperature poaching.</p></i>
